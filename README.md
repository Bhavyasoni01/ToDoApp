_A sneak peek at the app when you first open it!_

Hey everyone! I'm really excited to share my first Flutter application. I built this project from scratch as a beginner. It’s a simple to-do list manager designed to help you keep track of your tasks without any extra fluff.

## Features That Go Hard 🔥

* **Welcome Onboarding:** New users receive a warm greeting with two default tasks ("Welcome" and "Swipe Right to mark the task completed") to help them get started. It's easy to pick up!

    _Getting you started like a pro._

* **Effortless Task Completion:** Just **swipe right** on any task to mark it as completed.

    _Swipe right to flex on your tasks!_

* **Smart Auto-Sorting:** Once a task is done, it automatically moves to the bottom of your list, keeping your incomplete tasks front and center. Your most important stuff stays at the top.

    _Completed tasks chillin' at the bottom, letting incomplete tasks shine._

* **Intuitive Task Deletion:** Need to remove a task? Just **swipe left** and tap the delete icon. We added an extra tap to prevent those accidental deletes.

    _Bye bye, task! 👋_

* **Seamless Task Creation:** Tap the `+` button in the corner to add a new task. The input field uses a **label instead of a hint text** so you always know what you're typing, even mid-thought. You can either `Cancel` or `Save` your new task – it’s up to you!

    _Adding a new task with that slick label action._

* **Clear Empty State:** If you've completed all your tasks (or are just getting started!), the app gives you a friendly nudge: "No tasks, Create a task to get started." No confusing blank screens here!

    _When your list is so clean, it's sparkling._

## Tech Stack 🛠️

* **Flutter:** For building this sleek, cross-platform mobile app.
* **Hive:** A lightweight and super fast key-value database used for efficient local data storage and management. Gotta keep that data secure and snappy!
